    2.9.2 Short Summary
    Time Sentitive Networking (TSN) defines a set of protocols for dealing with time- sensitive data over bridged Ethernet networks. TSN promises to drive efficiency, in real-time/time-critical connectivity scenarios, by enabling convergence of traditional data traffic and control traffic with bounded latency under a standardized norm. The work should survey time-critical IoT use cases, compare traditional ethernet networks with TSN and present challenges/trends on the development of TSN.

1 General Remarks
One part of your final grade for the course on communication networks is a group research survey. You will be working in groups of three but will be evaluated indi- vidually. Your task is to work out a survey on a research field according to the topic you have chosen. You will be supervised by a member of the communication networks group that proposed the topic. This supervision should include regular meetings, in which you present the progress of your work.
For the survey, you will have to write a report (in LATEX with IEEE paper format) of 4.5 pages (1.5 pages per student). It must be stated which student authored which part of the report. Please be aware that we will use a plagiarism check to discover plagiarism. Plagiarism will immediately lead to failing the survey for the student who tried to copy contents without correctly citing. You can submit preliminary versions of your report to the supervisor to receive feedback. The final report is due on January 15, 2023.
At the end of the lecture time in February (as soon as we have the fixed date, you will be informed), you need to give a short presentation with all other students as participants. The presentation will be 10 minutes (per group) plus 5 minutes discus- sion/questions and again, each group member needs to present a part of the overall presentation.
The project is mandatory for all students that collect 10 credit points from the com- munication networks course. The others can earn bonus points for the final grade. The project is worth 20% of the final grade.
